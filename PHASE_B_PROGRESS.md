- Need to integrate with Resend or another email service
- Email templates need to be created

### **OAuth Configuration**
- Google and GitHub OAuth require API credentials to be configured
- Environment variables need to be set up for each provider
- Callback URLs need to be registered with OAuth providers

### **Testing Requirements**
- Unit tests for authentication logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for authentication flows
- Security testing for vulnerabilities
